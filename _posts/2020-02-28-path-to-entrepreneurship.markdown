**Since** starting college, I’ve been asked what I want to do over my career more times than I can count. I’ve developed a default answer that involves buzz words like R&D and next-gen technologies. Lately, though, my thoughts have been more and more devoted to the notion of starting a company of my own. I’ve heard many diverse opinions from students, founders, and investors whom I regard highly. I decided this would be a decent place to compose my thoughts. Here we go.

My favorite parts about college: learning new skills and building meaningful relationships. I love the feeling of answering a question that I was initially clueless about. There is immense satisfaction and growth in pushing my limits and expanding my knowledge. Looking back, I know that there were entire industries or sectors that were foreign to me. The more I learn, the more realize how much exists out there. I am confident that I want to continue developing new skillsets and never stop learning about the world. 
<br/><br/>
At the same time, I don’t want to be locked in a room or a box working on innovative technologies by myself. I would be bored out of my mind. I see significant value in collaborating with others and integrating a team's best thoughts into one. Not only is it more productive, its more enjoyable and memorable. 
<br/><br/>
I want my career to incorporate both of these. And don't get me wrong, there are definitely lots of jobs out there that meet these requirements. But the list gets shorter when I consider that the company has to work on innovative technologies, care about its customers, and make a substantial positive impact on the world. Why not just start a company where I can shape the culture and work on creating the impact that I desire? 
<br/><br/>
Well because its really hard. A select few ideas are worth pursuing and fewer still would be suited for my abilities. I idolize entreprenurial visionaries like Gates, Jobs, Musk, Ellison, Cuban, and others who were able to build empires and rally thousands around a common vision. I've read their biographies and listened to their philosophies, trying to understand the qualities which enabled them to become successful in their industries. 
<br/><br/>
The problem is that survivorship bias blurs the lines; for every success story, there are thousands of similar individuals who came close or fell short. Exceptionally talented and driven indivuals have tried and failed where others have succeeded with a bit of luck or opportunity. That's just how the game works I guess. 
<br/><br/>
I am part of an organization called <a href="http://cityfellows.co/">City Fellow</a> which exposes engineering students in LA to venture capitalists and startup founders. A key takeaway has always been that there exists a world outside of the FAANG tech giants. City Fellows meetings have been highlights of my college experience because they inspire me to question the assumptions that society impresses upon college students.
<br/><br/>
Currently, I'm living my life and I have my eyes open to opportunities that arise. If the right idea arises, I am determined to give entrepreneurship a shot with my fullest effort. My options are still open: graduate school, working in industry, founding a company. Let's see how the next year or so goes. I'll be back with an update if anything changes!
