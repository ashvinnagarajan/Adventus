Until this summer I guess I never really had a good idea of what being an adult was like. Adulthood was always a goal that would come later after college or even after marriage. But for the first time in my life, I got a taste of what it would actually be like. I had to take care of myself without feeling like I was in the sheltered bubble of high school or university life. And now as the summer seems to be coming to an end, I am reluctant to let go of my new found freedom. 

For the past ten weeks, I have been working at an aerospace consulting company in Los Angeles called Booz Allen Hamilton. I had an amazing opportunity to work on a team of 5 software engineers to develop a <a href="https://ashvinagarajan.github.io/#Projects">data visualization tool</a> for Docker and Kubernetes. After long days of work, I was joyed to come back to an apartment of my own and practice fine cooking skills with some of the best roommates in the world. And yes there were tons of adult-y chores like buying groceries, paying rent, or cleaning the apartment. As Matt likes to say, we used to cheer and chest bump each other when the onions were on sale or if the tomatoes looked perfect. 

But much more significant to my feeling of adulthood was the interactions with coworkers. For the first time, I wasn't in the bubble of university students still struggling to get past the latest round of midterms or finals; rather, there was a universal emphasis on family and long term career. My bosses became close friends and mentors and it was clear that they were just like me not too long ago. 

I am back home for the rest of the summer and already I feel excited to get back into industry and start making a name for myself in corporate life. However, I know I should enjoy every second of my college days because soon enough it will only be a memory. My freshman year went by at light speed, filled with learning and exploration, and I am thrilled to get back to the daily grind and see my friends regularly. University life definitely suits me well. 

But once again I am confronted with the return to adolescence. Being successful at college definitely requires a high degree of maturity, yet way too many people take every opportunity to get blackout drunk or skip class. In that environment, the temptations to stay in bed for a little longer and procrastinate homework hit hard for me as well.
