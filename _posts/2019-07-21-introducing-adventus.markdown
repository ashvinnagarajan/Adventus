Welcome to the innaugural post on my blog! This is something that I have been interested in starting for a long time and I am proud to say it has finally arrived. 

In Ancient Rome, when an emperor would return from a military campaign, there would be an extravagant ceremony known as an Adventus to recognize and to celebrate his accomplishments. When deciding on a name for this blog, I wanted to reflect a theme of celebration, not for military conquest, but for thoughts and emotions.  

One of my biggest gripes about university so far is the lack of private space to be alone with one's own thoughts. No matter where I go, I am always surrounded by roommates, classmates, professors, or more often, strangers. Certainly it would be impossible for every one of 45,507 students to find their own private bubble but that doesn't make me crave it any less fervently. 

And being surrounded by so many people doesn't make me feel any less alone. 

I’m sure I sound super dramatic right now and I don’t mean to be. I emphatically love so many things about being at college from my friends to the energy to the opportunities. In the past year I’ve changed 

And I’m sure I’ll have many more strong opinions about those that I look fnorward to sharing here.

Yours,
