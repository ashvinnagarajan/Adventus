**2020.** Wow I can't believe we are into a new <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/27/791546842/people-cant-even-agree-on-when-the-decade-ends">decade!</a> The last year and a half at college has absolutely flown by and it still shocks me that I am a sophomore already. I know I haven't made a post in a while, and I'm sorry for that. The flurry of finals and winter break swept the time away, but I'm back now and ready to type. I actually want to talk about my winter break trip and what it meant to me in this post. I was back home in Caldwell, NJ and it was one of the best weeks of my life <!--more-->

Fall quarter of my sophomore year was quite a crazy one. Finally I've been taking many more upper division courses in subjects that really excite me like quantum engineering, solid state physics, and thermodynamics. I achieved my goal of joining a research lab which has been one of my best decisions! I learn so much, and I am working on some really interesting projects at the intersection of Materials Science, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. Also, I've been making some significant <a href="">progress</a> in Bruin Racing on various projects within my Research and Development subteam. On the other hand, the pressure to find a summer internship and figure out the rest of my life has been quite a burden. Considering all of these things, its understandable that I haven't really had much time to think about much else.

This is why going back home for winter break was such a blessing. I finished up my finals at UCLA and took the first flight to New Jersey where I would stay at my best friend's house for a little over a week. I know how much of a nuisance I must have been for my hosts, and I am so thankful that they took me in anyway. They made me feel like part of the family. From that moment, I was free to sleep in and let go of some responsibility for a while. I slept in, drove around town with high school friends, ate unheathy food, and watched movies until 3am.

I loved hearing about how everyone is doing at college: radio ambassador, research on computer graphics, frat parties, smart IoT mousetraps, and so many other random things. My friends were always the sort of nerdy ones in high school. It's so heartening to see that everyone has found a place where they fit in and contribute in a meaningul way. In the busyness of college, it possible that a few weeks or even months go by without catching up with everyone, but everything is imme

My parents now live in San Jose, CA. My brother lives in Sunnyvale, CA. Somehow in the course of a few months, the Bay took over my life. There is definitely so much to love about it like tech culture, Hindu temples, Tesla superchargers, and amazing weather, but I don't know if it will feel like home anytime soon. My childhood home is being rented and my childhood friends are 3,000 miles away.
